The project is a Sudoku ganme and it is developed using python. Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
The aim of thi project is to create a Sudoku board allowing the user to interact and play the game with the help of a GUI.
