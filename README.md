### 1. About 
The project is a Sudoku game and it is developed using python. Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
The aim of this project is to create a Sudoku board allowing the user to interact and play the game with the help of a GUI.

### 2. Git
Usage of git for the whole project.

### 3. UML

The UML diagrams were created using Planttext.
+ Activity Diagram [Click here](https://github.com/ChocoChipFries/Software-Development-Project/blob/main/Activity%20Diagram.png )<br>      
In UML, an activity diagram is used to display the sequence of activities. Activity diagrams show the workflow from a start point to the finish point detailing the many decision paths that exist in the progression of events contained in the activity.

+ Class Diagram [Click here](https://github.com/ChocoChipFries/Software-Development-Project/blob/main/Class%20Diagram.png )<br>
A class diagram is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.

+ Component Diagram [Click here](https://github.com/ChocoChipFries/Software-Development-Project/blob/main/Component%20Diagram.png )<br>
A component diagram gives a bird's-eye view of your software system. Understanding the exact service behavior that each piece of your software provides will make you a better developer. Component diagrams can describe software systems that are implemented in any programming language or style.

### 4. Requirement Engineering
Two techniques were utilized to map functional and non-functional requirements: a standard variant and a professional variant.

### 11. IDE
+ The IDE used for this project is Visual Studio Code. 
+ Some of my favorite shortcuts that I frequently use are:
+ ``` F5``` (Debug)
+ ```Ctrl + H``` ( Replace)
+ ``` Ctrl + C/ Ctrl + V``` (Copy/paste)
+ ```Shift+ Alt + Arrow UP/DOWN``` (To Copy line(s) up or down)
+ ```Ctrl + Z / Ctrl + Y``` (To Undo/Redo)
+ ``` Ctrl + F ``` (To Find in the Script)

### 12. Functional Programming
  Functional Programming: prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as:
  + Only final data structures
  + (mostly) Side-effect-free functions
  + The use of higher-order functions
  + Functions as parameters and return values
  + Use closures / anonymous functions
